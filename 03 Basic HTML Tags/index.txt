We can either use single or double quotes in attributes.

 

The Heading Tag

<h1> Most important heading </h1>

<h2> Another heading H2 </h2>

<h3> Another heading H3 </h3>

<h4> Another heading H4 </h4>

<h5> Another heading H5 </h5>

<h6> Least important heading </h6>

Note: We should not use HTML headings to make text thick or bold.

The img Tag

Note: In src attribute, we have to specify the relative path of the image.
If you want to decrease the size of the image in html use width and height and mention that value in pixels (px)

<sub> this </sub> is subscript
