When we use the right tag in right place, it results in a better page layout, better indexing by search engines, and better user experience.

We use the following tag to get the job done

<header>  #It contains nav tag (Navigation bar)

<main>

<footer>

Above tags are used for website layout

 

Inside the main tag we insert the following tags:

<main>                  #The main opening tag

<section>              #A page section

<article>               #A self-contained content

<aside>                 #Content aside from the content (e.g. Ads etc.)

</main>                #the main closing tag

 

Creating a page like this is not necessary but it creates a readable and structured layout. Also, they are useful for SEO.

 

Link attributes

<a href=”/contact”> Contact Us </a>         

#above tag will allow the contact page to open in same tab

 

<a href=”/contact” target=’_blank’> Contact Us <a>                 

#above tag will open contact page in new tab

 

We can put any content inside an anchor tag (images, headings, etc. are all allowed)

 

If the page is inside a directory, we need to make sure that we link to the correct page. [Same applies to img tag as well]

 

We can add links to images like this

<a href=”/about”><img src=”a.jpg” width=”120”></a>

[Height of image will be set automatically]

 

The Div tag

div tag is often used as a container for other elements.

div is a block-level element. [Always takes full width]

 

The span tag

span is an inline container. [Takes as much width as necessary]
