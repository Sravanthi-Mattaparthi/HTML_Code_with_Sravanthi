Chapter – 1 (Creating my first website)
 We start to build a website by creating a file named index.html, index.html is a special filename that is presented when the website root address is typed.

 

A Basic HTML Page

<!Doctype html> - Specifies this is an html5 document

<html> - root of an HTML page

<head> - Contains page metadata

<title> Sravanthi’s Website </title>  - Contains title

</head>                                                   

<body> - Main body of the page (rendered by browser)

<h1> This is a heading </h1>  - heading tag

<p> My paragraph </p> - paragraph tag

</body> - closing body tag

</html> - closing html tag

 A tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.



 

Important Notes:

      Head & body tags are children of HTML tag.
      HTML is the parent of Head and Body tags.
      Most of the HTML elements have opening & closing tag with content in between opening and closing tags.
      Some HTML tags have no content. These are called Empty elements. For example, <br> tag
      We can either use .htm or .html extension to save our html code.
      You can use the “Inspect Element” or “View Page Source” option from chrome to look into a website’s HTML code.
 

HTML element = Start tag + Content + End tag

 

 

Comments in HTML

Comments in HTML are used to mark text which should not be parsed. They can help during documentation of the source code.

<!-- HTML Comment -->

 

Case Sensitivity

HTML is a case insensitive language. <H1> and <h1> tags are the same.
