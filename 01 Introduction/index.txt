HTML – Hyper Text Markup Language

Html is the language of the web. It is used to create websites.

We use HTML tags to define the look and feel of a website.

With an understanding of these tags and How to put them together, we can create beautiful websites easily!

Then why CSS and JavaScript
      HTML is used for defining the layout of a page – A barebone page structure.
      CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page created using HTML.
      JavaScript (JS) is used to program logic for the page layout. E.g. what happens when a user hovers on a text when to hide or show elements etc?
 

A Beautiful analogy
HTML = Card body (only metal)

CSS = Car paint, design, etc.

JavaScript = Car engine + Interior logic

 

We will start learning how to build beautiful layouts in this course.

 

Installing VS Code
We can use any text editor of our choice. Here, I am using VS Code because it is lightweight, open-source & from Microsoft.

      Go to google, search for VS Code, download and install it.
NOTE: You can write HTML even in Notepad. Text editors like VS Code just makes things easier.
